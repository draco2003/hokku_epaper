# Bigme F7 — A/B Over-The-Air Firmware Update

End-to-end OTA for the F7: the device downloads a new firmware image over HTTP,
writes it into the inactive A/B slot, flips the boot pointer, and reboots — with
the try-boot rollback ([`custom_firmware.md`](custom_firmware.md#boot--ab-rollback-safety-net))
as the safety net. Both the firmware client and the server are model-aware, so the
F7 and the huessen ESP32 share the same OTA plumbing.

## Device side (`firmware/bigme_f7/main.c`)

The frame-state advertises `"ota":1`. On a `200` poll response carrying
`X-Firmware-Update: <version>`, `do_refresh()` ignores the image body and runs:

```c
ota_init();
ota_get_image(OTA_PROTOCOL_HTTP, url);   // url = <server>/hokku/firmware.bin?model=bigme_f7
ota_verify_image(OTA_VERIFY_NONE, NULL); // flips the OTA-cfg to the freshly-written slot
ota_reboot();
```
### Confirming the new image

The new image does not keep itself just by booting. Every screen follows one
policy ([`common/all/ota_confirm.h`](../../../firmware/common/all/ota_confirm.h)):
an OTA'd image stays unconfirmed until the first fetch that reaches the server
(an image, or a "keep your picture" reply). That fetch confirms it. A fetch that
does not reach the server is retried in the same boot (3 fetches, 5 s apart);
after the last one the screen rolls back to the image it ran before. The
decision always completes in the new image's first boot, before any sleep.

How that maps onto this SoC's A/B boot (details in `main.c`, "A/B try-boot
rollback"):

- The OTA cfg (`image_cfg_t {seq, state}` at `0x180000`) names the slot the
  bootloader launches on **every** reset: power-on, watchdog, `HAL_WDG_Reboot`,
  and every hibernation wake, which is a full reboot through the bootloader.
- Every boot, `platform_init_level0` points the cfg at the other slot and arms
  a 16 s watchdog; at the boot milestone in `main()` the watchdog stops. A
  normally booted image points the cfg back at itself there.
- Before flipping to the new slot, `hokku_do_ota()` writes a marker ("slot N,
  not confirmed") into the state record (`0x341000`). When the new image boots
  and finds the marker for its own slot, it leaves the cfg on the previous slot.
- Confirm = point the cfg at its own slot and drop the marker. Roll back =
  `HAL_WDG_Reboot()` with the cfg still on the previous slot. A crash, power
  cycle or hibernation before confirming boots the previous slot as well; the
  previous image finds a marker that does not match its slot and drops it.
- An unconfirmed image refuses to OTA again: the other slot is its rollback.
- An image flashed over USB carries no marker and confirms at the boot
  milestone, as before.

- **Served image = the full `xr_system.img`, verbatim.** The SDK OTA discards the
  first `bl_size` (`0x8000`) bytes itself and writes the rest to the inactive
  slot, so no server-side slicing is needed. The image has no verify trailer
  (built without `mkimage -O`), so `VERIFY_NONE` is correct — `ota_get_image` still
  runs the per-section checksum walk, so a truncated/corrupt download is rejected
  before any cfg flip.
- `libota.a` links unconditionally (`-lota`), so **no `__CONFIG_OTA=y` is needed**
  (that flag only appends the verify trailer).
- The update slot alternates by A/B policy: running seq0 → writes slot1
  (`0x181000`); running seq1 → writes slot0 (`0x8000`). Both directions are valid.

### Bootstrapping

The *first* OTA-capable image must be flashed over **USB** — a pre-OTA image (or
stock OEM) has no OTA client to receive `X-Firmware-Update`. After that, updates
are over-the-air. Reflashing a stock unit needs USB too (stock OEM can't OTA). The
one-time fresh-unit bootstrap is documented in [`bootstrap.md`](bootstrap.md).

## Server side (model-aware)

- `python/hokku/screens/bigme_f7/firmware.py` serves the bundled
  `hokku-bigme_f7-<version>.img` verbatim (from `firmware/release/` in a dev tree,
  else `/usr/share/hokku-server/firmware/`). The version is parsed from the
  filename, which `ci-build.sh` takes from `main.c`'s `FIRMWARE_VERSION`.
- `python/hokku/screens/firmware_registry.py` maps `model_id` → firmware provider
  (`bundled_firmware_version` / `release_app_image`). Every OTA-capable model
  registers there.
- `flask_app.py`: `/hokku/firmware.bin?model=…`, the `X-Firmware-Update` signal,
  the version comparison, and `/api/status`'s `bundled_firmware_versions` map all
  resolve per-model. `/hokku/firmware.bin` defaults to the huessen reference model
  when no model is given (back-compat). The NVS config path stays huessen-only
  (the F7 has no NVS — its config is device-local FDCM).

### Triggering an update

- **Web GUI:** the screen's *Config* modal → "Update firmware on next refresh".
  The UI compares each screen against **its own model's** bundled version
  (`bundled_firmware_versions[model]`) — a bug where it compared against the single
  (huessen) global was fixed.
- **API:** `POST /hokku/api/screens/<name>/update {"enabled": true}`.
- **Console (test):** the `ota` command on the device.

### Bounded auto-retry

The pending flag is **not** consumed one-shot. For an **upgrade** the server
re-signals `X-Firmware-Update` on every poll until the device reports the target
version — so a transient failure (e.g. a dropped WiFi download) self-heals — capped
at `OTA_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (5) signals, after which it records an `ota_error`. A
same-version **re-flash** stays one-shot (no version change to confirm).

While the screen's check-in reports a battery below `OTA_MIN_BATTERY_MV`
(`screen_headers.py`, the dashboard's 0 %) the server sends no signal at all:
the update stays pending, the poll does not count against `OTA_MAX_ATTEMPTS`,
and a re-flash is not consumed. A check-in without a plausible reading is not
held. `/api/status` reports the hold as `ota_battery_hold_mv`.

## Adversarial review

Two independent Opus reviews + on-hardware testing found and fixed four defects
before/while flashing. All are in the committed firmware.

| # | Severity | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | near-brick (feature-broken) | XIP bias hardcoded to slot-0's `app_xip` — a slot-1 (OTA'd) image would execute slot-0 code and fault → rollback, *every* OTA | per-slot bias `0x13040 + seq*0x179000` |
| 2 | flash corruption | no mutex between the console `ota` and the refresh thread (two flash writers / HTTP sessions) | `g_ota_lock` mutex; console try-locks |
| 3 | latent brick | rollback would repoint the boot cfg at a slot an aborted OTA had already erased (blank) | arm only if `image_check_sections(fallback)==VALID` |
| 4 | brick on a non-A/B header | `hokku_do_ota` trusted the bootloader-derived erase address (a `ota_addr=0xFFFFFFFF` header wraps to erase slot0/bootloader) | range-guard the update slot to `[bl_size, 0x300000)`; **allow both A/B directions** (an earlier fix wrongly hardcoded slot1 and refused reverse-direction OTAs — caught on hardware) |

Non-brick items accepted: no hardware watchdog covers the ~1 MB download (bounded
instead by the SDK HTTP client's 180 s inactivity timeout; a hang is power-cycle
recoverable since the cfg flip is last).

## Verified on hardware

OTA proven in **both directions** (seq0↔seq1) via **both triggers** (console `ota`
and the server `X-Firmware-Update` path), with per-slot XIP, rollback-commit, and a
correct battery reading throughout. First fully user-driven web-GUI OTA: `1.2.0` →
`1.2.1`.

## Consequence for the A/B slots

The first OTA overwrites the inactive slot, which on a fresh unit holds the **OEM
factory firmware**. After that, both slots hold A/B versions of our firmware and
the rollback protects between them; the OEM is recoverable only via USB + a saved
dump (see [`restore_to_stock.md`](restore_to_stock.md)). This tradeoff was made
deliberately.
