# The Hokku appliance image

The easiest way to run Hokku: a ready-made Raspberry Pi OS image with the server
already installed. Write it to a microSD card, put it in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W,
power it on, and configure everything from your phone over WiFi. No keyboard, no
monitor, no terminal, no `pip`.

The image boots into a setup mode that raises its own WiFi access point. You join
it, a form opens, you fill in your WiFi details, and the Pi reboots onto your real
network with the server running.

## What you need

- **A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** (the recommended board — see the
  [hardware guide](hardware.md#the-server) for a tested kit).
  Any Pi that runs 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS will work; the Zero 2 W is the one
  the image is built and tested against.
- **A microSD card**, 8 GB or larger. The image expands to about 3.9 GB.
- **A USB power supply** and a cable.
- **A phone or laptop with WiFi**, to run the setup wizard.
- **A 2.4 GHz WiFi network.** The Pi Zero 2 W has no 5 GHz radio.

## 1. Write the image

Download `image_<date>-hokku.img.xz` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/defl/hokku_epaper/releases).

Write it to the card with [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
(*Choose OS → Use custom*), [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), or any
image writer. Both handle the `.xz` compression for you — no need to unpack it
first.

> **Don't apply Raspberry Pi Imager's own customisation settings** (the gear icon
> — hostname, WiFi, user account). The Hokku image does all of that through its
> own setup wizard, and Imager's settings can interfere with it.

Put the card in the Pi and connect power.

## 2. Join the setup network

First boot takes a minute or two. When it's ready the Pi raises an **open WiFi
network called `Hokku Setup`** — no password.

Join it from your phone or laptop.

Most phones detect the captive portal and pop the setup page open by themselves.
If yours doesn't, browse to **http://192.168.11.1** — every DNS lookup on this
network resolves there, so almost any address you type will land on the wizard.

## 3. Fill in the wizard

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Network name (SSID) + WiFi password** | The network the Pi will join once setup finishes. Pick from the scan list or type it in. Must be 2.4 GHz. |
| **WiFi country** | Sets the WiFi regulatory domain. Required — the radio stays disabled without it. |
| **IP address assignment** | DHCP (default, recommended) or a static IP with gateway and DNS. |
| **Device name** | The Pi's system hostname. |
| **Timezone** | Used for the refresh schedule, so photos change at the times you expect. |
| **mDNS / Bonjour** | Advertises the server under the *mDNS name* so you can reach it at `http://<name>.local:8080` instead of chasing an IP. On by default, as `hokku`. |
| **SSH access** | Optional. Enables remote terminal access. |
| **Samba file sharing** | Optional. Exposes the photo folder as a network share. |
| **Admin password** | Optional but **strongly recommended**, especially if you enable SSH — see [Default credentials](#default-credentials) below. |

Submit the form. The Pi applies everything and reboots; it takes roughly a minute
to come back on your real network.

## 4. Open the server

Disconnect from `Hokku Setup`, rejoin your normal WiFi, and open:

```
http://<mdns-name>.local:8080
```

That's the web app — upload photos, add frames, set the schedule. See the
[user manual](manual.md) for a full walkthrough.

If the `.local` name doesn't resolve (some Windows and Android setups don't do
mDNS reliably), find the Pi's IP address in your router's DHCP client list and
use `http://<ip>:8080` instead.

## Flashing a frame from the appliance

The appliance can flash a frame over USB itself — open **Flash a screen** in
the web app, no separate setup machine needed.

The Pi Zero 2 W has only a **single USB data port**, and it can be exactly one
thing per boot: a USB *host* (which is what flashing a frame needs) or a USB
*peripheral* (the [serial console](os_pi_usb_console.md)). The appliance
switches it for you at setup time — the wizard hands the port over to host mode
on the reboot that ends setup, so a configured appliance is always ready to
flash. Setup mode keeps the serial console; normal operation gets the frame
port.

What you need to do:

1. Power the Pi from its **PWR** port, leaving the data port free.
2. Connect the frame to the data port through a **micro-USB→USB-A OTG adapter**
   (a plain charging cable carries no data). It appears in **Flash a screen**.
3. Flash it, then unplug the frame.

Plugging a frame in before boot is fine on a configured appliance — the port is
already a host, so there is nothing to negotiate. (This was *not* true of an
earlier build that ran the port in dual-role OTG mode, where a frame attached at
boot could wedge startup outright. That mode was dropped.)

While the appliance is in **setup mode** the port is the serial console instead,
so **Flash a screen** can't drive a frame — which costs nothing in practice,
since the web app isn't running during setup anyway.

## If something goes wrong

### The Pi never appears on your network

It fixes itself. A watchdog checks the WiFi connection after every setup: if the
Pi can't connect within about three and a half minutes of booting — wrong
password, network out of range, typo in the SSID — it **automatically reverts to
setup mode and raises the `Hokku Setup` network again**. Rejoin it and correct
the details.

When it reverts, the USB data port goes back to being a
[serial console](os_pi_usb_console.md) as well, so a Pi that keeps failing to
join your network can always be inspected over a cable.

### `Hokku Setup` never appears

Give it a full two minutes from power-on. If it still doesn't show up, the card
may not have been written correctly — rewrite it and try again. To see what the
Pi is actually doing without a monitor, use the
[USB serial console](os_pi_usb_console.md): one cable to your computer gives you
a login prompt.

### Starting over

To send a configured appliance back to setup mode — to move it to a different
WiFi network, for example — run this on the Pi over SSH (the serial console is
not available outside setup mode):

```sh
sudo /usr/lib/hokku-installer/reset.sh
```

It clears the setup marker and reboots, and the `Hokku Setup` network comes back.
Your photos and settings are left alone. The USB data port returns to serial-
console duty for the duration of setup, and goes back to being a frame port when
you finish the wizard again.

### Updating the server

A new release doesn't need a new SD card. With SSH enabled in the wizard, run
this on the Pi:

```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defl/hokku_epaper/main/tools/hokku_upgrade.py
sudo python3 hokku_upgrade.py
```

Pick a release from the list. The script backs up `/var/lib/hokku` (photos,
settings, renders) to `/var/backups/hokku` first and stops if the card is too
full for that — `--backup-dir` can point it at a USB stick instead. It prints
the command that rolls back to the old release and that backup. Re-rendering
the whole library afterwards is optional and takes a while on a Pi Zero 2 W;
frames keep their current picture and pick up new ones as they are rendered.
It also offers to tick "Update firmware on next refresh" for every frame on
older firmware than the new release serves.

## Default credentials

The image ships with a default system login:

```
username: hokku
password: hokku
```

This exists so the serial console and first-time SSH work at all. **Change it**
— either by setting an admin password in the wizard, or afterwards with `passwd`
— particularly if you enabled SSH. The Pi is only as protected as your local
network until you do.

The Hokku web app itself has no login. Anyone on your network who can reach port
8080 can manage your photo library. That's deliberate for a home appliance, but
worth knowing before you expose it any further.

## Building the image yourself

The image is built with [pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) from the
recipe in [`os/pi/`](../os/pi/) — see [`os/pi/README.md`](../os/pi/README.md).
It is also built automatically by CI and attached to every GitHub release.
