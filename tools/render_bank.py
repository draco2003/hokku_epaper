"""Render a config on an image and measure it, without a human and without glass.

This is the workhorse the search and the preference fit both stand on: one call
renders an ImageConfig through the *production* pipeline and returns a vector of
measurements of the result. Nothing here decides what is good — deliberately.
Every earlier attempt in this project to collapse these numbers into a single
score got overturned by someone looking at the panel, so the collapsing is left
to a weighting fitted against real verdicts (see fit_preference.py) and this
module only supplies the evidence.

Three things make the measurement worth trusting:

**The panel model, not the ink table.** At full resolution every pixel is one of
six inks, so comparing pixels to the source measures dithering, not colour. The
Yule-Nielsen model from the 1733-patch campaign (n=1.38, 1.50 dE residual)
predicts what a block of dithered ink actually looks like, which is what an eye
integrating over that block sees. Metrics prefixed ``yn_`` use it.

**Two references, because they answer different questions.** Against the raw
source, a bright photograph always measures "too dark" — the panel tops out at
L* 66.9 and no pipeline can fix that, so that error is not actionable. Against
the source rescaled into the panel's own range (``adapted_reference``), the
question becomes the answerable one: given 56 L* of range, is it used well?
Both are reported; ``_adapted`` marks the second.

**Detail, separately from colour.** A minimum-dE gamut map once raised measured
red-wall chroma from 11 to 33 while flattening the shading into a slab, and the
chroma metric called that an improvement. ``detail_l``/``detail_c`` are the
guard against that, and they are why this returns a vector and not a number.

Results are cached in SQLite keyed by image content, config slug, display (the
correction LUT rides on it), crop decision, resolution and a hash of the metric
code, so a search that revisits a config pays for it once and a row is never
served to something it was not measured for. Workers compute; the parent writes.
